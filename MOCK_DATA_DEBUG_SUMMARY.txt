MOCK DATA DEBUGGING - FRONTEND ISOLATION COMPLETE
================================================================================

SUMMARY:
The frontend has been successfully isolated from all backend data calls.
All Supabase database queries have been replaced with high-fidelity mock data.

================================================================================
CHANGES MADE:
================================================================================

FILE: src/App.tsx
LOCATION: loadCompanies() function (lines 22-148)

WHAT WAS CHANGED:
1. ✓ Commented out the entire Supabase data fetch block
   - The original code is preserved in block comments /* ... */
   - Includes: supabase.from('companies').select('*')

2. ✓ Added high-fidelity mock data (8 company records)
   - Mock data structure matches Company type exactly:
     * id (string)
     * name (string)
     * sector (string: IT, Energy, Healthcare, Finance, Retail)
     * city (string: Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla, Banja Luka)
     * website (string | null)
     * description (string | null)
     * rating_avg (number: 4.0-4.5)
     * reviews_count (number: 58-245)
     * created_at (ISO timestamp string)
     * updated_at (ISO timestamp string)

3. ✓ Wired up mock data to component state
   - setCompanies(mockCompaniesData)
   - setFilteredCompanies(mockCompaniesData)

4. ✓ Added clear debug markers:
   - "// --- DEBUG: Using mock data to isolate frontend ---"
   - Instructions on how to restore live data

================================================================================
VERIFICATION:
================================================================================

✓ Build successful (npm run build completed without errors)
✓ No TypeScript errors
✓ Bundle size reduced (153.72 kB vs previous 278.95 kB)
  - This confirms Supabase client code is tree-shaken when not used

✓ Components verified - NO data fetching found in:
  - src/components/ChatBox.tsx (pure UI component)
  - src/components/CompanyCard.tsx (pure UI component)
  - src/components/CompanyList.tsx (pure UI component)

✓ Only one data fetch location found and mocked:
  - src/App.tsx::loadCompanies() ✓ MOCKED

================================================================================
TESTING THE ISOLATED FRONTEND:
================================================================================

Run the dev server:
  npm run dev

Expected behavior with mock data:
1. App loads immediately with 8 companies displayed
2. All filtering works (by city, sector, rating)
3. Chat interface works with mock data
4. No network requests to Supabase
5. No database errors in console

Test cases to verify:
- [ ] Page loads without white screen
- [ ] 8 company cards are visible
- [ ] Search for "IT companies in Sarajevo" shows 2 results
- [ ] Search for "4+ star retail" shows Bingo and BBI Centar
- [ ] Click on website links (they should work)
- [ ] Filter by different sectors and cities

================================================================================
RESTORING LIVE DATA:
================================================================================

When ready to reconnect to Supabase:

1. Open: src/App.tsx
2. Find: "// --- DEBUG: Using mock data to isolate frontend ---"
3. Uncomment the Supabase fetch block (remove /* and */)
4. Delete or comment out the mock data section
5. Save and test

================================================================================
DIAGNOSTIC INSIGHTS:
================================================================================

If the app NOW WORKS with mock data:
→ The issue is in backend communication (Supabase connection, query, or data structure)
→ Check: .env variables, Supabase migration status, RLS policies

If the app STILL shows white screen:
→ The issue is in frontend rendering (component logic, TypeScript errors, or UI bugs)
→ Check: Browser console for errors, component props, React error boundaries

Next debugging steps:
1. Test with mock data (current state)
2. Open browser dev tools → Console tab
3. Open browser dev tools → Network tab
4. Look for any JavaScript errors or warnings
5. Verify no Supabase network requests are being made
